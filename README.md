# PRO-C75-BEDTIME-STORIES--AUTHENTICATION
In Class 75, You Learned To Authenticate A User In Their App By Asking Them To Enter A Username And Password. You Also Learned To Change Security Rules For Their Database So That Only Authenticated Users Can Access - Read And Write Values - To The Database. In This Project, You Have To Apply The Concepts Learned In Class By Adding A Login Screen To The “Bedtime Stories” App, So That Only Authorized Users Would Be Able To Log In And Access Their Stories.
